## 13. Backend Tech Stack (current repo)

### Framework & Language

- **FastAPI (Python)** — the repository's backend service is implemented in Python using FastAPI. It's lightweight, async-capable, and well-suited for REST + GraphQL APIs.

### What the repo contains

- Entry point: `backend-python/src/main.py` — initializes the FastAPI app and defines a basic `/health` endpoint.
- Configuration: `backend-python/src/core/config.py` — Pydantic Settings (via `pydantic-settings`) reading values from the repo `.env` (see `env_file` in the Settings config).
- GraphQL: `backend-python/src/graphql/` — schema pieces (`mutation.py`, `query.py`, `subscription.py`) and additional GraphQL resolvers under feature folders (e.g., `auth/graphql`, `email/graphql`).
- Feature routers: `backend-python/src/*/router.py` — modular routers for `auth`, `email`, etc.
- Database: `backend-python/src/database/db.py` and migration folder under `backend-python/src/database/migration/`.
- Docker: `backend-python/docker/dockerfile` and top-level `docker-compose.yml` for containerized runs.

### Config & Environment

- The settings model expects environment variables such as:

  - `APP_VERSION`
  - `APP_NAME`
  - `APP_STAGE` (e.g., `development`)
  - `BASE_URL`

- The settings loader in `core/config.py` points to the repo `.env` (two levels up from `core/config.py`), so the project root `.env` is used in dev.

### How to run locally (recommended)

From the repository root or terminal, examples below use the `backend-python` folder as working directory.

1. Using uvicorn (recommended for development):

```
cd backend-python
# run the ASGI app with reload for development
uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 1911 --reload
```

Note: `src.main:app` points to `backend-python/src/main.py`'s `app` variable. The project also has `if __name__ == '__main__'` which calls uvicorn with `main:app` when executed from `src`.

2. Or via Python directly (from `backend-python/src`):

```
cd backend-python/src
python main.py
```

3. Docker / docker-compose

- The project includes a Dockerfile under `backend-python/docker/dockerfile` and top-level `docker-compose.yml` — you can run the service via the compose setup if you prefer containerized dev.

### Health-check and quick test

- Health endpoint: GET /health
- Example (from host/port used above):

```
curl http://127.0.0.1:1911/health
# expected response: {"status":"All praise to Allah"}
```

### GraphQL & REST notes

- The backend exposes both REST routes (modular routers under feature folders) and GraphQL resolvers. GraphQL definitions and registration live in `backend-python/src/graphql/`.
- Look for GraphQL feature resolvers under `backend-python/src/*/graphql/` (for example, `auth/graphql/resolver.py`).

### Key files & locations (quick reference)

- `backend-python/src/main.py` — app initialization and simple health route
- `backend-python/src/core/config.py` — Pydantic settings and `.env` configuration
- `backend-python/src/graphql/` — GraphQL schema pieces (query/mutation/subscription)
- `backend-python/src/auth/` — auth feature (routers, schema, domain/service)
- `backend-python/src/email/` — email feature (routers, service)
- `backend-python/src/database/db.py` — DB access & session setup
- `backend-python/requirement.txt` — Python dependencies
- `backend-python/docker/dockerfile` — docker image for backend

### Dev notes & suggestions

- Settings are loaded via `pydantic-settings` (BaseSettings). Update the top-level `.env` to change runtime values.
- The FastAPI app sets `debug=True` when `APP_STAGE == "development"`.
- When adding new endpoints, follow the existing modular pattern: add a `router.py` in the feature folder and register it with the app.
- For GraphQL additions, add types and resolvers under `src/graphql/` or the feature `graphql/` subfolder and register them in the GraphQL setup.

---

This section now reflects the actual backend in this repository (FastAPI + Python). If you want, I can also add a small example of a GraphQL query, or add a checklist for local dev setup (venv/pip install, env template).
